# aao-dr-courtroom
Python code to generate a Catalysis script to generate a DanganRonpa-style courtroom for the Ace Attorney Online case maker.

Yes, that's a very long chain, but it's currently the best way to do that.

(... In AAO. If we're talking PyWright, it's like a million times easier. No trickery required.)

Since AAO does not require any programming experience to use, all the instructions on how to use the code are in comments in the code itself, as sort of a guide.

You will, however, need Catalysis, which is found somewhere else on GitHub.
